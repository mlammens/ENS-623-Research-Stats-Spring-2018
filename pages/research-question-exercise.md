# ENS 623 - Semester Project - Research Question Exercise

## DUE: 2018-02-14

To begin your semester projcet, I'd like you complete the exersice documented in Chapter 1, Box 3 of Karban et al. 2014.
You can find this chapter on our BlackBoard page.
While going through this exercise, I want you to focus on generating questions related to your thesis topic or on an analysis topic of your choosing.
For those of you who have begun collecting data for your thesis project, it is probably best to use this project to push forward with the analyses of these data.
For those of you who are just starting out, you can use this exercise to start narrowing down your potential research focus.
I strongly encourage you to communicate with me by email, phone call, etc. during the process if you want more guidance.
