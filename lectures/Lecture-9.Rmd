# Hypothesis Testing

* What is a hypothesis? 
* How do we test our hypothesis?

The answers to these questions, with respect to this course, are primarily based on frequentist statistics.


## Example

Let's say we have a sample of observations that we want to know if they come from some population with a known value for $\mu$ (i.e., we know the population mean). 
We can see how (un)likely it is that the sample estimates come from this particular population, by looking at where these values fall in a *t* distribution. That is, calculate the *t* statistic:

$$
t_s = \frac{St - \theta}{S_{St}}
$$


## *t*-test

* Looking at differences between two samples of data. 
The *differences* should be *t* distributed.
* **Major assumptions** - the samples are drawn from populations that are:
    1. Normally Distributed
    2. Equally varied (i.e. equal variance)
    3. Each observation is *independent*
    
## We select the error rate

General concencus is $p = 0.05$. This is known as Type-I error, or $\alpha$.

### Type-I versus Type-II error

* **Type-I error: $\alpha$** - our test suggests there is an effect, but there really is not one
* **Type-II error: $\beta$** - when you fail to detect an effect that really occurs

### Statistical power

The reciprical of Type-II error ($\beta$) is **power**. 

$$
power(1-\beta) \propto \frac{ES \sqrt{n} \alpha}{\sigma}
$$

#### How do we increase statistical power?

Increase the sample size.

* Distribution of the mean becomes narrower
* Acceptance region becomes narrower
* Curves overlap less
* Type II error rate becomes smaller

# What are the general steps to hypothesis testing?

See p. 33-34 in Q&K. Fisher's approach below:

* Construct null hypothesis ($H_0$)
* Choose a test stat that measures deviation from null
* Collect data and compare the value of the test stat to the known distribution of that stat.
* Determine p-val
* Accept or reject null

What are some of the potential problems with this approach?

### Our data or something more extreme

When we use a sampling distribution for our test statistic (e.g., the *t* distribution), we are asking "what is the probability of observing our data, or something more extreme, in the long run, if $H_0$ is true."
Mathematically, this can be written as:

$$
P(data|H_0)
$$

## Examples of parametric hypothesis testing

Above we discussed the generic form of the *t* statistic:

$$
t_s = \frac{St - \theta}{S_{St}}
$$

where $St$ is the value of some statistic (e.g., the mean) from our **sample**, $\theta$ is the **population** value for that statistic, and $S_{St}$ is the estimated standard error of the statistic $St$ (based on our sample).

How can we use this formula to test whether two samples are drawn from the same population?

Imagine the case where we have two different samples, and for each we're testing whether the means are different from the population means.
We then have:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{y_1}-\mu_1}{s_{\bar{y}_1}}
$$

and

$$
t = \frac{\bar{y_2}-\mu_2}{s_{\bar{y}_2}}
$$

If the two samples are drawn from the same population, then $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, or $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$.

We can then write our *t* stat as:

$$
t = \frac{(\bar{y_1} - \bar{y_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}}
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{y_1} - \bar{y_2}}{s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}}
$$

where $s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}$ is the standard error of the difference between the means and is equal to:

$$
s_{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2} = 
\sqrt{
\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}
(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2})
}
$$


### Differences in fecundity of intertidal gastropods in two different intertidal zones (Example 6A in Logan, Box 3.1 in Q&K)

Ward and Quinn (1988) investigated the differences in fecundity of *Lepsiella vinosa* in two different intertidal zones (mussel zone and littorinid zone). 

Get the data and have a quick look

```{r}
gastro <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/ward.csv")
summary(gastro)
View(gastro)
```

Make a box plot to help assess differences in variance and deviations from normality.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = gastro, aes(x = ZONE, y = EGGS)) +
  theme_bw()

```

Calculate means and standard deviations of each group separatley. We will be using `dplyr` for this.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

gastro %>%
  group_by(ZONE) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(EGGS), Var = var(EGGS))

```


Run *t* test.

```{r}
(gastro_t_test <- t.test(data = gastro, EGGS ~ ZONE, var.equal = TRUE))

gastro_t_test$estimate[1] - gastro_t_test$estimate[2]

```


### Metabolic rates of northern fulmars (sea-bird)

Furness and Bryant (1996) measured the metabolic rates of male and female breeding northern fulmars, and tested if there were any observalbe differences in these rates.

Get the data and have a look

```{r}
fulmars <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/furness.csv")
fulmars
summary(fulmars)
```

Make a box plot to help assess differences in variance and deviations from normality.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = fulmars, aes(x = SEX, y = METRATE)) +
  theme_bw()

```

#### Challange

Are the variances the same?

Calculate means and standard deviations of each group separatley. We will be using `dplyr` for this.

```{r}
fulmars %>%
  group_by(SEX) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(METRATE), Var = var(METRATE))

```

Based on inequality of variances, use Welch's *t*-test.

```{r}
(fulmars_t_test <- t.test(data = fulmars, METRATE ~ SEX, var.equal = FALSE))
```

# Non-parametric tests

Let's say our data don't fit the assumptions of the *t* test. What are our options?

## Rank based tests - Mann-Whitney test

Look at ranks, rather than actual values.

From Q&K p. 47:

1. Rank all observations, ignoring groups. Tied observations get the average of their ranks.
2. Calculate the sum of the ranks for both samples. If $H_0$ is true, then you should expect similar sums.
3. Compare the smaller rank sum to the probability distribution of rank sums, based on repeated randomization of observations to groups.
4. If sample sizes are large, the probability distribution of rank sums approximates a normal distribution and the *z* statistic can be used.

## Randomization tests

Powell and Russel (1984, 1985) investigated differences in bettle consumption between two size classes of eastern horned lizards.


Get the data and look at it

```{r}
lizard <- read.csv(file = "https://mlammens.github.io/ENS-623-Research-Stats/data/Logan_Examples/Chapter6/Data/beetle.csv")
head(lizard)
summary(lizard)
```

Have a look at the box plots for these data.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(data = lizard, aes(x = SIZE, y = BEETLES) ) +
  theme_bw()
```


Let's also look at the histograms of these data

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = lizard, aes(x = BEETLES, fill = SIZE) ) +
  facet_grid( . ~ SIZE ) +
  theme_bw()
```

#### Challenge

What do you observe here that seems like a strong violation to the assumptions of a *t* test?


#### Major Challenge

1. Calculate the *t*-statistic for differences in number of beetles consumed the two size classes of lizards.
2. Randomize/ shuffle the data.
3. Calculate the **new** *t*-statistic. Repeat this 999 times.
4. How does the observed *t*-stat compare to the generated *t*-stats?


```{r}
## Run t-test
t.test(data = lizard, BEETLES ~ SIZE)

## Record the original t-stat
t_orig <- t.test(data = lizard, BEETLES ~ SIZE)$statistic

## Initiate vector of new t-stat values
t_rand <- c()

## Set the number of reps (shuffles) we want to use
reps <- 1000

## Begin for loop to randomize data
for ( int in 1:reps){
  
  ## Shuffle the data
  lizard_shuffled <- data.frame(SIZE = sample(lizard$SIZE), BEETLES = lizard$BEETLES)
  
  ## Run the t-test on the new data, and save the t-stat to the t_rand vector
  t_rand <- c( t_rand,
               t.test(data = lizard_shuffled, BEETLES ~ SIZE)$statistic )
  
}

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(data = NULL, aes(x = t_rand)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = t_orig, colour = "red") +
  theme_bw()

```


To calculate how likely our original *t* statistic is, look at how many values are more extreme.
Remember to check both tails.

```{r}
t_rand_extreme <- sum(abs(t_rand) > t_orig)

(p_t_orig <- t_rand_extreme/ reps)

```

# Multiple testing

* If you perform a singly hypothesis test, using $\alpha = 0.05$, what is the probability that you reject the null hypothesis, even though the null is correct?

* If you perform 20 hypothesis tests, using $\alpha = 0.05$, what is the probability that in at least one of those cases, you will reject the null hypothesis, even though it is correct?


### Example of problems with multiple comparisons

Make some random data - 10 sets of 10 observations from the standard normal.
**We know that all of these sets are from the exact same population!**

```{r}
my_data <- list()
for (i in 1:20) {
    my_data[[i]] <- rnorm(10)  #Note the double brackets for a list
}
```

Run a *t* test for all possible pair-wise comparisons.

```{r}
p_vals <- matrix(ncol = 20, nrow = 20)
for (i in 1:19) {
    for (j in (i + 1):20) {
        p_vals[i, j] <- t.test(my_data[[i]], my_data[[j]])$p.value
    }
}
p_vals
```

How many are false possitives?

```{r}
sum(p_vals < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```
